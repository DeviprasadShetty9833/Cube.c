# Overview

<br> This is a simple and creative C program that visually prints a 3D cube pattern in the console based on the number of sides (length of edge) provided by the user.
<br> 
<br> The program dynamically adjusts the cube’s dimensions and alignment to create a 3D optical illusion effect using only text characters, enhancing logical thinking and pattern programming skills.
<br> 

# Key Features
<br> 1. Dynamic Cube Size
<br> The user inputs the number of sides (length of cube edges), and the program adjusts the drawing automatically.
<br> 
<br> 2. 3D Visual Effect
<br> Smart use of characters ($ and spaces) to simulate a three-dimensional cube appearance in text format.
<br> 
<br> 3. Input Validation
<br> Ensures that the cube size is reasonable (positive integer, and not too small) to prevent console distortion.
<br> 
<br> 4. Clear Structure
<br> Modular code design (separate functions for top, sides, and bottom drawing) making it easy to modify or expand.
<br>
