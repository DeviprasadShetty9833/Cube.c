# Overview:

<br> This is a simple and creative C program that visually prints a 3D cube pattern in the console based on the number of sides (length of edge) provided by the user.
<br> 
<br> The program dynamically adjusts the cube‚Äôs dimensions and alignment to create a 3D optical illusion effect using only text characters, enhancing logical thinking and pattern programming skills.
<br> 

# Key Features:

<br> ![1.](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.-Dynamic%20Cube%20Size-blue?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> The user inputs the number of sides (length of cube edges), and the program adjusts the drawing automatically.
<br> 
<br> ![2.](https://img.shields.io/badge/2.-3D%20Visual%20Effect-blue?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Smart use of characters ($ and spaces) to simulate a three-dimensional cube appearance in text format.
<br> 
<br> 3. Input Validation
![3.](https://img.shields.io/badge/3.-Input%20Validation-blue?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Ensures that the cube size is reasonable (positive integer, and not too small) to prevent console distortion.
<br> 

> ‚ä°‚Å† If the user inputs a *size n*, then the pattern follows this transformation:
> - &nbsp; Initial Shape: A solid *(2n - 1) √ó (2n - 1)* square of ' $ ' characters.
> - &nbsp; Diagonal Layer Transformation: The 1st to (n-1)th diagonal layer from bottom-left to top-right will be partially carved i.e replaced by spaces (' '). All other positions will remain as ' $ '.

<br> 4. Clear Structure
![4.](https://img.shields.io/badge/4.-Clear%20Structure-blue?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=white)
<br> Modular code design (separate functions for top, sides, and bottom drawing) making it easy to modify or expand.
<br> 

# Concepts Used:

<br> Programming Language: C (Standard C99)

<br> Core Concepts:
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Loops (for, while) for pattern drawing

<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Command Line Interface (CLI) interaction
<br> 

# Focus Areas:

<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Logical Thinking
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Pattern Programming
<br> ‚ä°‚Å† Dynamic Output based on user input
